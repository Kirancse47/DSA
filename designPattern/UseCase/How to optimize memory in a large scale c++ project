üîë Strategies to Optimize Memory in C++
1. Choose the right data structures

Prefer std::vector over std::list/std::map unless you specifically need linked behavior.

vector stores elements contiguously ‚Üí better cache locality.

For large datasets:

Use unordered_map instead of map (average O(1) vs O(log N)).

If keys are small integers, use std::vector or std::array as lookup tables instead of hash maps.

2. Avoid unnecessary copies

Use references (&) or move semantics (std::move) to avoid deep copies.

Use emplace_back instead of push_back where possible.

Use const& in function arguments for large objects.

3. Memory Pools / Custom Allocators

Frequent new/delete calls ‚Üí heap fragmentation.

Solution: memory pool (allocate a big chunk and manage small allocations yourself).

STL containers can use custom allocators if you need tighter control.

4. Avoid virtual where not needed

Virtual tables consume extra memory (pointer per object + vtable storage).

If polymorphism isn‚Äôt required ‚Üí use templates/CRTP (static polymorphism).

5. Use shrink_to_fit() wisely

Containers like vector, string, deque may keep extra capacity.

After bulk insertions & deletions, call .shrink_to_fit() to release unused memory.

6. Use small types

Don‚Äôt store int if values fit in uint8_t or uint16_t.

Prefer bit-fields or std::bitset for flags.

Pack structs carefully (watch alignment & padding).

7. Cache locality

Store related data together.

Use struct of arrays (SoA) instead of array of structs (AoS) if you access only some fields frequently.

Example: in a physics engine, keep positions, velocities in separate arrays ‚Üí better vectorization.

8. Lazy loading & resource management

Load data (images, configs, logs) on demand instead of preloading everything.

Use RAII (smart pointers like unique_ptr) to ensure memory is freed automatically.

9. Use std::string_view

Instead of copying substrings (std::string), use std::string_view ‚Üí zero-copy, just a pointer+length.

10. Profiling & Tools

Use Valgrind / Massif, Google Perftools, or Heaptrack to find leaks & memory hogs.

Use asan/lsan (AddressSanitizer/LeakSanitizer) during testing.

‚ö° Example: struct padding optimization
struct Bad {
    char a;
    int b;
    char c;
}; 
// Size = 12 (because of padding)

struct Good {
    int b;
    char a;
    char c;
}; 
// Size = 8 (better packing)


üìå Summary

Prefer contiguous containers (vector).

Avoid unnecessary copies (move/ref).

Use memory pools for frequent allocations.

Reduce struct/class padding.

Profile & measure memory usage.



#let‚Äôs build a very simple memory pool so you see the idea.
A memory pool is basically:

Allocate a big chunk of memory at once.

Divide it into fixed-size blocks.

Manage allocation/deallocation manually instead of using new/delete for each object.

üîß Example: Simple Memory Pool for Fixed-Size Objects
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

class MemoryPool {
    struct Block {
        Block* next;
    };

    Block* freeList;   // points to free blocks
    std::vector<void*> chunks; // to keep track of big allocations
    size_t blockSize;
    size_t blocksPerChunk;

public:
    MemoryPool(size_t blockSize, size_t blocksPerChunk = 1024)
        : freeList(nullptr), blockSize(blockSize), blocksPerChunk(blocksPerChunk) {}

    ~MemoryPool() {
        for (void* chunk : chunks) {
            ::operator delete(chunk); // free all allocated memory
        }
    }

    void* allocate() {
        if (!freeList) {
            // allocate new chunk
            void* chunk = ::operator new(blockSize * blocksPerChunk);
            chunks.push_back(chunk);

            // split chunk into blocks and link them into freeList
            char* start = static_cast<char*>(chunk);
            for (size_t i = 0; i < blocksPerChunk; i++) {
                Block* block = reinterpret_cast<Block*>(start + i * blockSize);
                block->next = freeList;
                freeList = block;
            }
        }
        // Pop from freeList
        Block* head = freeList;
        freeList = head->next;
        return head;
    }

    void deallocate(void* ptr) {
        Block* block = static_cast<Block*>(ptr);
        block->next = freeList;
        freeList = block;
    }
};

/// Example usage:
struct MyObject {
    int x, y;
};

int main() {
    MemoryPool pool(sizeof(MyObject));

    // Allocate objects
    MyObject* a = new (pool.allocate()) MyObject{1, 2};
    MyObject* b = new (pool.allocate()) MyObject{3, 4};

    std::cout << "a: " << a->x << "," << a->y << "\n";
    std::cout << "b: " << b->x << "," << b->y << "\n";

    // Destroy + return memory to pool
    a->~MyObject();
    pool.deallocate(a);

    b->~MyObject();
    pool.deallocate(b);

    return 0;
}

üìù How it works:

MemoryPool allocates chunks (default 1024 blocks per chunk).

Each block is placed into a free list.

allocate() takes a block from the free list.

deallocate() puts the block back into the free list.

We use placement new (new (pool.allocate()) MyObject) to construct an object in the pre-allocated block.

‚úÖ Benefits

Much faster than calling new/delete for each object.

Prevents heap fragmentation.

Useful when you know object size in advance (game engines, DBs, networking).
