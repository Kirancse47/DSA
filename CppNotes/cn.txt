🟢 BASIC LEVEL
1️⃣ What are the layers of the OSI model?

7 Layers:

Physical – bits, cables, signals

Data Link – frames, MAC addressing, error detection

Network – IP routing, logical addressing

Transport – TCP/UDP, reliability

Session – manage connections (setup, teardown)

Presentation – encryption, compression, translation

Application – end-user protocols (HTTP, FTP, DNS)

2️⃣ OSI vs TCP/IP
OSI	TCP/IP
7 layers	4 layers
Reference model	Practical implementation
Clear separation	Application layer merges (App+Presentation+Session)
3️⃣ Layer of devices

Hub → Physical

Switch → Data Link (Layer 2)

Router → Network (Layer 3)

Firewall → Network/Transport/Application

4️⃣ TCP vs UDP
TCP	UDP
Connection-oriented	Connectionless
Reliable (ACKs, retransmissions)	Unreliable, no ACK
Ordered delivery	May arrive out of order
Slower (overhead)	Faster (used in DNS, streaming)
5️⃣ ARP

Address Resolution Protocol: Resolves IP → MAC address in a LAN.
Host broadcasts “Who has IP x.x.x.x?” and the owner replies with its MAC.

6️⃣ DNS

Domain Name System: Resolves hostnames (e.g., www.google.com
) → IP.
Hierarchy: Root → TLD (.com) → Authoritative → Resolver.

7️⃣ DHCP

Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol: Automatically assigns IP, subnet, gateway, DNS to clients.
Steps: DORA — Discover → Offer → Request → Acknowledge.

8️⃣ NAT

Network Address Translation: Converts private IPs to public IPs for internet access.
Types: Static, Dynamic, PAT (Port Address Translation).

9️⃣ HTTP vs HTTPS

HTTP: Plain text

HTTPS: Uses SSL/TLS encryption, protects from sniffing and MITM attacks.

🟡 INTERMEDIATE LEVEL
1️⃣ TCP 3-Way Handshake

SYN — Client → Server

SYN-ACK — Server → Client

ACK — Client → Server → Connection established ✅

2️⃣ TCP 4-Way Termination

Client → FIN

Server → ACK

Server → FIN

Client → ACK → Connection closed.

3️⃣ TCP Flow Control

Uses a sliding window.
Receiver advertises window size → sender limits unacknowledged data to that window.

4️⃣ TCP Congestion Control

Algorithms:

Slow Start

Congestion Avoidance (AIMD)

Fast Retransmit

Fast Recovery

Prevents network overload.

5️⃣ Routing

Static: Manually configured routes.
Dynamic: Routers learn routes using protocols (RIP, OSPF, BGP).

6️⃣ Distance Vector vs Link State
Distance Vector	Link State
Routers share distance to neighbors	Routers share full topology
e.g., RIP	e.g., OSPF
Slow convergence	Faster convergence
7️⃣ VLAN

Virtual LAN: Logically divides a switch into multiple broadcast domains → improves security and reduces collisions.

8️⃣ Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)

Prevents loops in Layer-2 networks by blocking redundant paths dynamically.

9️⃣ SMTP / POP3 / IMAP

SMTP – sends mail (port 25)

POP3 – downloads mail (port 110)

IMAP – syncs mail (port 143)

🔟 FTP vs SFTP

FTP – plain text (port 21)

SFTP – encrypted via SSH (port 22)

🔴 ADVANCED LEVEL
1️⃣ Latency vs Throughput

Latency: Time delay (ms) to send a packet.

Throughput: Data per second (Mbps).
Low latency ≠ high throughput always.

2️⃣ MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit)

Max size of a packet that can be sent without fragmentation (e.g., 1500 bytes in Ethernet).

3️⃣ What happens if TCP ACK is lost?

Sender retransmits data after timeout; receiver discards duplicate (sequence number check).

4️⃣ Out-of-order packets

TCP reorders them using sequence numbers before delivering to application.

5️⃣ Bandwidth-Delay Product (BDP)

BDP = Bandwidth × RTT → Maximum data that can be in transit.

6️⃣ What is QoS?

Quality of Service: Mechanisms that prioritize some traffic (like VoIP) over others.

7️⃣ ARP Cache

Stores IP-to-MAC mappings temporarily; avoids repeated broadcasts.

8️⃣ What happens when you open www.google.com?

Browser checks DNS cache → resolves domain to IP.

TCP 3-way handshake with server.

TLS handshake (if HTTPS).

Browser sends HTTP request.

Server responds with HTML data.

Connection closes or kept alive.

9️⃣ Software Defined Networking (SDN)

Separates control plane (decision-making) from data plane (forwarding).
Controller centrally manages switches.

🔟 Load Balancing (L4 vs L7)

L4: Based on IP/port (TCP/UDP level).

L7: Based on application data (URL, headers).

⚙️ SYSTEM-LEVEL QUESTIONS
1️⃣ How does ping work?

Uses ICMP Echo Request/Reply:

Sends Echo Request (type 8)

Receives Echo Reply (type 0)
→ Measures round-trip time (RTT) and packet loss.

2️⃣ What happens if ARP cache is full?

Old entries are replaced (LRU policy) or aged out after timeout.

3️⃣ How router forwards packets

Router checks destination IP → routing table → next hop → decrements TTL → forwards to next interface.

4️⃣ How TCP ensures reliability

Sequence numbers

Acknowledgements

Retransmissions

Checksum

Sliding window (flow control)

5️⃣ Connectionless but reliable?

UDP itself is unreliable, but protocols built on top (e.g., QUIC, RTP) can add reliability.

6️⃣ Half-open connection

When one side closes but the other still thinks it’s open (e.g., crash without FIN).
TCP uses keep-alive to detect and close such connections.

7️⃣ DNS caching

Each record has TTL; resolvers cache results for that duration to reduce query load.

8️⃣ IPsec

Encrypts and authenticates IP packets at network layer.
Modes: Transport and Tunnel.

⚡ BONUS – Mini Practical Q&A
Q. Difference between Unicast, Broadcast, Multicast, Anycast
Type	Description
Unicast	One-to-one
Broadcast	One-to-all in subnet
Multicast	One-to-many (specific group)
Anycast	One-to-nearest node
Q. What is SYN flood?

DoS attack — attacker sends multiple SYNs without completing 3-way handshake, exhausting server’s connection queue.

Q. What’s inside an Ethernet frame?
Field	Description
Dest MAC	6 bytes
Src MAC	6 bytes
EtherType	2 bytes
Payload	46–1500 bytes
CRC	4 bytes
