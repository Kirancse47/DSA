#Starting gdb
gdb ./a.out                    # Start with executable
gdb ./a.out core               # Debug with core dump
gdb ./a.out <pid>              # Attach to running process

#Running Program
run arg1 arg2                  # Run program with args
start                          # Run and stop at main
continue / c                   # Resume execution

#Breakpoints
break main                     # Break at main
break 25                       # Break at line 25
break file.cpp:40              # Break at line 40 in file.cpp
tbreak main                    # Temporary breakpoint
delete 1                       # Delete breakpoint 1
info breakpoints               # Show all breakpoints

#Stepping
step / s                       # Step into function
next / n                       # Step over function
finish                         # Run until function returns
until                          # Run until loop/line exits

#Inspecting Code
list                           # Show source code
backtrace / bt                 # Show call stack
frame 2                        # Switch to frame 2
info locals                    # Show local variables
info args                      # Show function arguments

#Variables & Memory
print x                        # Print variable x
display x                      # Auto print x each step
set var x=10                   # Change variable value
x/4xw &arr                     # Examine memory (4 words hex)

#Threads
info threads                   # Show all threads
thread 3                       # Switch to thread 3
break foo if x==5              # Conditional breakpoint

#Watchpoints
watch x                        # Stop when x changes
rwatch x                       # Stop when x is read
awatch x                       # Stop on read/write

#Exiting
quit / q                       # Exit gdb
